## Door-Restart-System 6.3.3
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gamekuchen/DoorRestartSystem/v6.3.3/total?style=for-the-badge)

## Plugin Description: DoorRestartSystem

**Compatible with:** SCP: SL Exiled 9.0+

The **DoorRestartSystem** plugin introduces an immersive feature where the facility undergoes a "Door Software Restart." During this event, all affected doors are fully closed and locked for a configurable duration, simulating a temporary system-wide malfunction. Once the restart process is complete, doors unlock and return to normal operation.

Rumor has it that these malfunctions might be the result of someone spilling their coffee on the door control system while scrambling to evacuate the facility.

### Key Features:

-   **Configurable Settings:**
    
    -   Enable or disable the system entirely.
        
    -   Adjust the probability, duration, and delay of restarts.
        
    -   Fine-tune which zones or door types are impacted.
        
-   **Advanced Lockdown Customization:**
    
    -   Control whether specific areas, such as SCP rooms, checkpoints, airlocks, elevators, or armory doors, are affected.
        
    -   Individual zone-based or per-room chances allow tailored experiences for each playthrough.
        
-   **Enhanced Immersion:**
    
    -   Dynamic lighting effects with customizable flicker frequency and colors during lockdowns.
        
    -   Integrated CASSIE announcements, including startup and ending messages, with optional glitching or jamming effects.
        
-   **Debugging and Performance:**
    
    -   Debugging options to monitor and test the system during development or server setup.
